# knowledge/

The generated UML 2.5.1 (and companion XMI 2.5.1) knowledge base skills read from. **Nothing under
`knowledge/<version>/` or `knowledge/xmi/<version>/` is committed to this repository** - it's
generated on your own machine by `uml4net-sage fetch` + `uml4net-sage generate`, from OMG's own XMI
and PDF files, which are themselves never committed either (see the root `CLAUDE.md`, "Committed vs
git-ignored", and `NOTICE`).

## Committed here

- `registry.json` - the static list of UML versions (and, in `xmiVersions`, XMI specification
  versions) this tool knows about (mirrors `Uml4Net.Sage.Knowledge.KnownUmlVersions`/
  `KnownXmiVersions`), so skills can see what's available without invoking the CLI.
- `metamodel.schema.json`, `index.schema.json`, `datapackage.schema.json` - JSON Schema
  documentation of the generated shapes below. None of these are copyrighted OMG content - they
  describe uml4net-sage's own output format.

## Generated per version (git-ignored)

`knowledge/xmi/<version>/` is a **top-level sibling**, not nested under any UML version - the OMG XMI
specification versions independently of UML, even though both happen to be "2.5.1" today:

```
knowledge/xmi/<version>/
├── datapackage.json                    # its own, separate Frictionless package
└── spec/                               # identical shape to knowledge/<version>/spec/ above
    ├── index.json / index.md           # rows carry "document": "XMI" to disambiguate from the UML spec index
    └── clauses/<number>-<slug>.md
```

`knowledge/installed.json` (also git-ignored) records which UML version(s) - and, independently,
which XMI specification version(s) - are fetched/generated on this machine, and which UML version is
the default - see `Uml4Net.Sage.Knowledge.InstalledVersionsStore`.

## Why `datapackage.json` and not a bespoke index

`datapackage.json` describes only the three genuinely tabular resources (the `index.json` files) as
an OKF Frictionless Data Package, with a real Table Schema per resource. It's deliberately **not**
the manifest skills read through - they read `metamodel/index.json` etc. directly at their stable,
well-known paths, exactly as mycelium-hypha's skills do. The Frictionless format's actual value here
is external-tool interoperability and a standard vocabulary for licensing/provenance metadata, not
an indirection layer - see `datapackage.schema.json`'s `$comment` for the full reasoning.

## Provenance tiers

Every skill answer should be tagged with where the fact came from:

- **NORMATIVE** - a verbatim quote from `spec/` (UML) or `xmi/<version>/spec/` (XMI), i.e. the OMG
  specification text itself.
- **MODEL** - read directly from the metamodel/Standard Profile XMI (an OCL constraint body, a
  feature's multiplicity, a stereotype's base metaclass).
- **DERIVED** - computed or inferred here (e.g. a clause number cited without the PDF fetched).
